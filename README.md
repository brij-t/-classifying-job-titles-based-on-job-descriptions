Hiring trends recently have changed, the long mundane list of links through which a candidate had to go through has been replaced by platforms which can match job seekers and employers. However, the current strategy used by employers has stringent requirements. For instance, A job description might state a need for a candidate with a background in computer science for a role of Data analyst; which might eliminate a candidate with a degree in statistics; who might be suitable for the job of a data analyst. One of the reasons for such requirements by employers is the increase in candidates having specialized skills, which reduces the time & cost of providing training to the employees. However, this results in potential candidates missing job opportunities. Also, the rate at which the economy is changing due to the evolution of technology has made the job market unpredictable; candidates are not aware of the emerging job trends. In this research, we aim to help improve the hiring process, which would beneﬁt both the employers and candidates by classifying job titles based on job descriptions. The classiﬁcation process involves the use of Natural language processing techniques with Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms.
